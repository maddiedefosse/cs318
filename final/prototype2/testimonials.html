         "It was a wonderful and very special day. 
         The staff, teachers and head of school were all so 
         ready and willing to show us the wonders of MCDS and 
         the students who thrive there. It's an exciting place
         to learn and we are so happy that our grandsons have 
         this opportunity! Thank you everyone!" -Pat Schutt

         Brilliant idea! Please expense it to the Auction.  
         Thanks for thinking of this special touch. -Dana Asmuth

        "Plus, it’s a truly fun evening! Casual summer wear is the
        dress. The food prepared by Gwen Bosben is delightful.
        The auction items are numerous, affordable and creative.
        You will be amazed at the transformation of school grounds 
        into a luau by the lake." -Sheila Young

        "First is to give you a BIG hug and thank you for our Velvet 
        Room experience. It was far   beyond what I expected. It was
        a grand slam! Thanks you so much."- Dr. Michael Kim

        "What a fantastic evening.  You did a great job and everyone

        "Just wanted to pass on this compliment. You three are not 
        only great at getting what needs to get done, but doing it in
        a way that makes our volunteers/sponsors/donors feel
        special/appreciated. Thank you."

        "The whole night embodied the very essence of MCDS. It was a 
        community of people, some close friends and some new friends, 
        who enjoyed time together and worked toward a common goal of 
        supporting and celebrating an amazing school. Having the gala 
        at the school only heightened the awareness of our purpose for 
        the night. Additionally, while maybe not the main goal of the 
        evening, I am aware of two separate couples, one with young 
        children and the other who do not yet have children, who were 
        won over by the sense of community, generosity, and spectacular 
        senior speeches. You all created an evening to help  sustain the 
        school financially and embrace potential new families. It was an
         amazing feat. Thank you to all who were involved in putting this 
         together and pulling it off beautifully."-Angie Jaenke

        "I was so happy with the feeling of community and celebration at 
        Camp Rocky — it was really special. Thanks for all your work to 
        make it festive, fun, and meaningful.  It was a truly special 
        night." -Dana Asmuth

        "Congratulations on a wonderful evening! There were so many lovely
         touches everywhere and a very warm, festive atmosphere that made
         you feel like we were more than just a school, but a giant 
         extended family.  There were smiles everywhere.  At our table, 
         we had two couples who had never been to the event and they were
         incredibly impressed and really enjoyed themselves.  Todd and
         I had such a great time.  Being a part of the parent group this
         year truly made me appreciate how wonderful it is to have a
         night where parents, teachers, and students can celebrate
         together.""

         "I think I’ve said this to you all at one point this week, 
         but kudos to you and your committee for the best live auction
          and silent auction selections we’ve ever had — there was 
          something for everyone and some very exciting new things — 
          it was so fun to watch that live auction bidding!"
