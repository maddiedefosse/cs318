        <h3>Is it OK to eat eggs from chickens I’ve raised in my backyard?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
        <p>As an animal rights group, we cannot condone using animals for any reason, which is why PETA promotes a healthy vegan lifestyle. However, we would not oppose eating eggs from chickens treated as companions if the birds receive excellent care and are not purchased from hatcheries. Make sure you’re ready for the commitment of adopting chickens, as they will continue to be a part of your family long after they stop producing eggs.</p>

        <h3>I have an ant problem. I’d rather not kill the ants, but I do want to get rid of them. What should I do?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
        <p>Avoid using insect sprays. Pesticides are the number two cause of household poisonings in the U.S., as people and companion animals breathe in the toxic air. The best way to keep ants out of your house safely and naturally is by using products you may have in your kitchen cabinets right now. Try pouring a line of cream of tartar, red chili powder, paprika, or dried peppermint at the place where you think ants might be entering the house; they won’t cross it. You can also try washing countertops, cabinets, and floors with equal parts vinegar and water.</p>

        <h3>Is it safe to feed my dog or cat a vegetarian diet?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
        <p>It’s likely that your cat or dog will thrive on a vegetarian diet. Studies have shown that ailments associated with meat consumption in humans, such as allergies, cancer, and arthritis, also affect our companion animals. Unless they eat raw meat, some dogs require supplemental taurine and L-carnitine (available in health food stores).</p>
